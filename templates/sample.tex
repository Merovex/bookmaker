\section{Welcome to Bookmaker}

Bookmaker provides authors a free, ruby-based production toolchain for self-published paper and electronic books using the LaTeX document preparation system. The code base borrows heavily from Kitabu, while replacing Prince as the PDF generator (due to licensing issues).

Bookmaker requires familiarity with LaTeX. Many TeX features are lacking when compiling to HTML, EPUB or MOBI.
